## Order Table
a comprehensive list of top-level fields for the Order object was compiled, along with their data types. The data types are mapped to common formats like string, int, date, boolean, object, and list for database integration. Note that some field names may vary slightly across documentation versions, and the user should verify exact names and types in the official documentation at [Order Object Documentation]([invalid url, do not cite]).

Data Type Mapping and Explanation
The data types are mapped as follows:

string: Includes String, ID, URL, and enums (e.g., CurrencyCode, OrderCancelReason), suitable for text fields in a database.
int: Includes Int and UnsignedInt64, for integer values like quantities or counts.
date: Includes DateTime, stored as ISO 8601 strings, for date and time fields.
boolean: Includes Boolean, for true/false values.
object: Includes complex types like MailingAddress, MoneyBag, and others, which contain nested fields and require further querying for full data.
list of strings: For fields like discountCodes, which are lists of scalar strings.
list of objects: For fields like additionalFees, which are lists of complex objects.
list (connection): For connections like lineItems, which are paginated lists, requiring cursor-based pagination for full data retrieval.


## Order Details
lineItems is a field within the Shopify GraphQL API's Order object, representing individual products and quantities in an order.
Itâ€™s a connection (paginated list) of LineItem objects, each with fields like id, title, quantity, and price.
Check Order Object Documentation and LineItem Documentation for details.
Line Items Field

Field Name	Data Type	Description
lineItems	list (connection)	List of LineItem objects in the order.
Key LineItem Fields

Field Name	Data Type	Description
id	string	Unique identifier for the line item.
title	string	Product or variant title.

Notes
lineItems is nested within the Order object, requiring subfield queries for complete data (e.g., variant, product).


## Order Fulfilment
Key Points
Fulfillment status and details like tracking number are within the Shopify GraphQL API's Order object, primarily via fulfillments and fulfillmentOrders fields.
fulfillments is a list of Fulfillment objects containing tracking info (e.g., trackingNumber, trackingUrl).
fulfillmentOrders groups line items for fulfillment, with status details.
displayFulfillmentStatus provides a summary status (e.g., FULFILLED, PENDING).
Check Order Object Documentation, Fulfillment Documentation, and FulfillmentOrder Documentation.
